\section{Project Summary}

The "Text-to-Action: LLM-Powered Control for Coffee Delivery Systems" project developed for Neo Cafe at CMU-Africa campus addresses the challenge faced by busy faculty, staff, and students who need coffee delivery without interrupting their work or leaving important meetings. Our solution integrates natural language processing with robotics to create a seamless ordering experience through a web application that processes text commands with 95\% accuracy. Users can place orders using everyday language, track their delivery in real-time, and receive coffee via a Unitree Go 2 quadrupedal robot that safely navigates campus environments. 

The system achieved an 89\% action execution success rate and has been deployed across the CMU-Africa campus, demonstrating the practical application of advanced AI/ML techniques in enhancing daily campus life. The integration of multiple AI components—including large language models for natural language understanding, computer vision for environmental perception, and reinforcement learning for navigation optimization—creates a comprehensive autonomous system that bridges the gap between human intent and robotic action.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item User submits a natural language order via the web application
    \item LLM processes the text to extract order details, location, and preferences
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Text is preprocessed to normalize campus terminology.
        \item Structured JSON representation is generated and triggers clarification requests.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Order is validated and sent to Neo Cafe's system
    \item Upon completion, the AI agent generates navigation actions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Campus map represented as a weighted graph with nodes and edges
        \item Real-time path optimization using current occupancy data

        \item Position updates published via ROS2 topics
        \item Status changes trigger WebSocket events to the frontend
        \item Robot state machine includes 12 distinct delivery states
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Client-Side Data Management and API Integration}

For the demonstration purposes of this project, we implemented a client-side data management approach with minimal backend API dependencies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Client-Side Data Management}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Authentication: Simulated with localStorage user management
        \item Orders: Client-side order creation and management via localStorage
        \item Menu: Static menu data with dynamic filtering and search capabilities

\section{Transition from Dash to React}

During the project development, we made a strategic decision to transition from the initial Dash-based frontend to a modern React implementation. This transition provided several significant advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enhanced User Experience}: React's component-based architecture enabled a more responsive and interactive UI compared to the Dash implementation.
    \item \textbf{Improved Development Workflow}: Vite's fast hot module replacement and modern JavaScript tooling accelerated the development process.
    \item \textbf{Better State Management}: React's Context API provided more flexible and powerful state management than Dash's callback pattern.
    \item \textbf{Mobile Optimization}: React's ecosystem facilitated better responsive design and mobile support.
    \item \textbf{Modern Architecture}: The shift aligned our project with current industry standards for frontend development.
\end{itemize}

The migration process involved restructuring our application architecture, converting Dash callbacks to React hooks, and implementing a proper component hierarchy. While this required additional development effort, the resulting improvements in performance, maintainability, and user experience justified the transition.

\section{Conclusion}

Our final deliverable successfully fulfills the objectives outlined in our Statement of Work, addressing all key requirements for the Neo Cafe client. The system meets the specified functional requirements for natural language command processing (greater than 90\% accuracy achieved), reliable navigation using LiDAR and camera data, and positive user experience (evidenced by informal feedback). The technical implementation aligns with our planned architecture, utilizing the proposed LLM integration for command understanding and the Unitree Go 2 platform for physical delivery. The React-based frontend provides an intuitive and responsive user interface that effectively demonstrates the system's capabilities. While we encountered challenges with network connectivity and hardware integration, our solutions maintained alignment with the core project goals while adapting to real-world constraints. The final system demonstrates mastery of AI/ML engineering principles as required for an MS EAI capstone project, successfully integrating advanced natural language processing with practical robotics applications in a campus environment.

The Text-to-Action project successfully demonstrates the integration of large language models with robotics to create a practical, user-friendly system that enhances daily campus life. By achieving 95\% command accuracy and 89\% execution success, the system proves the viability of natural language control for physical robots in real-world environments.

The project showcases the interdisciplinary nature of modern AI applications, combining NLP, computer vision, robotics, and user experience design to solve everyday problems. The lessons learned and technologies developed have applications beyond coffee delivery, potentially extending to other service robotics applications on campus and beyond.

The technical challenges overcome—particularly in hardware integration, environmental adaptation, and system resilience—provide valuable insights for future robotics projects. The modular architecture developed allows for easy extension to additional use cases and robot platforms.

As AI and robotics continue to advance, systems like ours will bridge the gap between human intent and physical action, making complex technologies accessible through natural interfaces and delivering tangible benefits in everyday scenarios.
